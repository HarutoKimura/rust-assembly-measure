# Enhanced Benchmarking Methodology

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced microbenchmarking methodology implemented to address reviewer concerns about the original measurement setup. The improvements are based on the CryptOpt paper's rigorous approach to cryptographic performance measurement.

## Reviewer Concerns Addressed

The original review highlighted several critical gaps in the microbenchmarking setup:

> ### Incomplete Description of Benchmarking Setup
> 
> Microbenchmarking is sensitive to system-level noise. The experimental setup lacks critical details:
> 
> * Was CPU core pinning used?
> * Was Turbo Boost, frequency scaling, SMT, or ASLR disabled?
> * What number of iterations, batching strategies, and cycle measurement methods were used?
> * Were warm-up runs performed?
> 
> These details are essential for reproducibility and fair comparison, particularly when differences are small.

## Complete Solution Implementation

### 1. CPU Core Pinning ✓

**Implementation:** `setup_benchmark_environment.sh` script with automatic core isolation

```bash
# Generated helper script for CPU pinning
./run_benchmark_pinned.sh cargo run curve25519 mul 5
```

**Details:**
- Reserves the last core for OS activity (following CryptOpt methodology)
- Uses `taskset` to pin benchmark processes to dedicated cores
- Automatically detects optimal core configuration based on system topology
- Prevents context switching noise during measurements

**CryptOpt Reference:** The paper states "the optimisation processes are pinned to one logical CPU core using taskset", with one physical core always left free for general OS activity.

### 2. Turbo Boost and Frequency Scaling Control ✓

**Implementation:** Automatic detection and configuration of CPU frequency settings

```bash
# Disables turbo boost and sets performance governor
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
```

**Details:**
- Sets CPU governor to "performance" mode
- Disables Intel Turbo Boost / AMD Boost dynamically
- Fixes CPU frequency to minimum available for stability
- Includes restoration script to revert changes after benchmarking

**CryptOpt Reference:** During performance evaluation, "the CPU frequency was fixed, boosting was disabled, and the governor was set to 'performance'" to reduce system noise.

### 3. SMT (Simultaneous Multi-threading) Handling ✓

**Implementation:** Optional SMT control with user choice

```bash
# Optional SMT disabling for noise reduction
echo off | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control
```

**Details:**
- Detects current SMT status automatically
- Provides user choice to disable SMT for reduced noise
- Based on CryptOpt finding that SMT "does not improve the optimisation itself"
- Includes automatic restoration after benchmarking

**CryptOpt Reference:** The paper notes they "did not observe differences in optimization behavior on machines with SMT enabled or disabled."

### 4. ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) Control ✓

**Implementation:** ASLR control for consistent memory layout

```bash
# Disable ASLR for consistent memory layout
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

**Details:**
- Current ASLR status detection and reporting
- User-configurable ASLR disabling for consistent measurements
- Automatic restoration of original ASLR settings
- Memory layout consistency for reduced measurement variance

**CryptOpt Reference:** While not explicitly mentioned in CryptOpt, ASLR affects memory layout which can impact "memory-biased performance impacts" that CryptOpt addresses through aligned code assembly.

### 5. Enhanced Iteration and Batching Strategy ✓

**Implementation:** CryptOpt's R3-validation methodology with Fisher-Yates randomization

```rust
// Randomized batch execution order (R3-validation)
let execution_order = randomize_batch_order(config.num_batches, &mut rng);
for &batch_idx in &execution_order {
    let cycles = measure_single_batch(&measurement_func, current_batch_size);
    batch_results[batch_idx] = cycles;
}
```

**Details:**
- **Number of batches:** 31 (matching CryptOpt's empirically determined optimal value)
- **Randomization:** Fisher-Yates algorithm for batch execution order
- **Dynamic batch sizing:** Automatically scales to achieve 10,000 cycle goal per batch
- **Median statistics:** Uses median of each batch, then median-of-medians across runs

**CryptOpt Reference:** Uses "rotated-round-robin fashion" based on R3-validation with "nob = 31 was found to work well" and randomization using "Fisher-Yates algorithm to even out prediction behavior."

### 6. Precise Cycle Measurement Methods ✓

**Implementation:** Enhanced RDTSC with proper memory barriers

```rust
#[inline(always)]
pub fn precise_rdtsc() -> u64 {
    unsafe {
        // Memory fence to ensure all prior operations complete
        _mm_mfence();
        _rdtsc()
    }
}
```

**Details:**
- **Memory barriers:** `mfence` instruction before RDTSC (following DUDECT methodology)
- **High precision:** Uses RDTSC for cycle-accurate measurements
- **Overflow handling:** Saturating subtraction to handle counter overflow
- **Compiler optimization prevention:** Inline assembly barriers

**CryptOpt Reference:** Uses "high-precision clocks available on x86-64 CPUs, including the Timestamp Counter" and the final measure is "the median value of any batch to drop outlier measurements."

### 7. Comprehensive Warm-up Procedures ✓

**Implementation:** Multi-phase warm-up strategy

```rust
// Phase 1: Warm-up to mitigate initialization bias
warmup_function(|| warmup_func(), config.warmup_iterations);

// Phase 2: Calibration run to determine optimal batch size
let calibration_cycles = measure_single_batch(&measurement_func, current_batch_size);
```

**Details:**
- **Extensive warm-up:** 50 iterations by default (configurable)
- **Initialization bias mitigation:** Dedicated warm-up phase before measurement
- **Calibration phase:** Separate run to determine optimal batch sizing
- **Memory barrier integration:** Prevents over-optimization during warm-up

**CryptOpt Reference:** While not explicitly termed "warm-up runs," CryptOpt's strategy of collecting "multiple batches" and using "median thereof" directly mitigates "potential warm-up biases."
