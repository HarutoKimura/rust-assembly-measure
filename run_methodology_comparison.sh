echo
echo "=== Analysis Summary ==="
echo
echo "Key Improvements Demonstrated:"
echo "1. MEASUREMENT PRECISION:"
echo "   - Original: Fixed batch size may under/over-measure different functions"
echo "   - Enhanced: Dynamic batch sizing ensures consistent ~10,000 cycle precision"
echo
echo "2. BIAS REDUCTION:"
echo "   - Original: Sequential execution order (GAS→NASM→CryptOpt always)"
echo "   - Enhanced: Fisher-Yates randomized order prevents systematic bias"
echo
echo "3. STATISTICAL ROBUSTNESS:"
echo "   - Original: Single measurement per run, high variance"
echo "   - Enhanced: Median-of-medians across multiple runs, low variance"
echo
echo "4. WARM-UP HANDLING:"
echo "   - Original: No systematic warm-up, cold-start effects"
echo "   - Enhanced: Multi-layered warm-up (global + per-function + targeted)"
echo
echo "5. QUALITY ASSESSMENT:"
echo "   - Original: No validation of measurement stability"
echo "   - Enhanced: Coefficient of variation tracking and quality ratings"
echo
echo "6. REPRODUCIBILITY:"
echo "   - Original: Environment-dependent, hard to reproduce"
echo "   - Enhanced: Automated environment setup, documented methodology"
echo
echo "=== Recommendation ==="
echo "The enhanced methodology provides:"
echo "  • More reliable performance comparisons"
echo "  • Better detection of small performance differences"  
echo "  • Scientific reproducibility and transparency"
echo "  • Addresses all reviewer concerns about microbenchmarking rigor"
echo
echo "For publication-quality results, always use the enhanced methodology:"
echo "  ENHANCED_MEASUREMENT=1 ./run_benchmark_pinned.sh cargo run <curve> <op> 5"
