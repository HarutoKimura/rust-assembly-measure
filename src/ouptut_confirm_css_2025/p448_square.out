=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     301 cycles
  NASM Format:    292 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 323 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -6.81% (323 vs 301 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -9.60% (323 vs 292 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.840% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 1.580% (Good (CV < 5%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.376% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 302.14 cycles
    Median: 302 cycles
    Std Dev: 2.54 cycles
    95% CI: [301.63, 302.65] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 294.99 cycles
    Median: 292 cycles
    Std Dev: 4.66 cycles
    95% CI: [294.08, 295.90] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 323.36 cycles
    Median: 323 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.22 cycles
    95% CI: [323.11, 323.62] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
