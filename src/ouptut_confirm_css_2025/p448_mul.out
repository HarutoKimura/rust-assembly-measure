=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     373 cycles
  NASM Format:    368 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 433 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -13.86% (433 vs 373 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -15.01% (433 vs 368 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 1.471% (Good (CV < 5%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 1.872% (Good (CV < 5%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.756% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 370.14 cycles
    Median: 373 cycles
    Std Dev: 5.45 cycles
    95% CI: [369.07, 371.21] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 370.56 cycles
    Median: 368 cycles
    Std Dev: 6.94 cycles
    95% CI: [369.20, 371.92] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 432.44 cycles
    Median: 433 cycles
    Std Dev: 3.27 cycles
    95% CI: [431.79, 433.09] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
