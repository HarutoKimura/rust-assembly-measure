=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     323 cycles
  NASM Format:    325 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 400 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -19.25% (400 vs 323 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -18.75% (400 vs 325 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.661% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 0.485% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 1.262% (Good (CV < 5%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 322.64 cycles
    Median: 323 cycles
    Std Dev: 2.13 cycles
    95% CI: [322.22, 323.06] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 324.15 cycles
    Median: 325 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.57 cycles
    95% CI: [323.84, 324.46] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 396.94 cycles
    Median: 400 cycles
    Std Dev: 5.01 cycles
    95% CI: [395.96, 397.92] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
