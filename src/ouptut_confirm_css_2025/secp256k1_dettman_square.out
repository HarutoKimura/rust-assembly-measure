=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     196 cycles
  NASM Format:    182 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 226 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -13.27% (226 vs 196 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -19.47% (226 vs 182 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.218% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 196.00 cycles
    Median: 196 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [196.00, 196.00] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 182.00 cycles
    Median: 182 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [182.00, 182.00] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 225.59 cycles
    Median: 226 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.49 cycles
    95% CI: [225.49, 225.69] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
