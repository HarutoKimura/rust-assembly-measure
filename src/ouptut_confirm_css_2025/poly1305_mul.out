=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     81 cycles
  NASM Format:    83 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 93 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -12.90% (93 vs 81 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -10.75% (93 vs 83 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 81.00 cycles
    Median: 81 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [81.00, 81.00] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 83.00 cycles
    Median: 83 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [83.00, 83.00] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 93.00 cycles
    Median: 93 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [93.00, 93.00] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
