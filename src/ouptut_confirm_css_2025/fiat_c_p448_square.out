=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     317 cycles
  NASM Format:    322 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 296 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: +7.09% (296 vs 317 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: +8.78% (296 vs 322 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 1.104% (Good (CV < 5%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 1.281% (Good (CV < 5%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.548% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 318.61 cycles
    Median: 317 cycles
    Std Dev: 3.52 cycles
    95% CI: [317.92, 319.30] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 322.71 cycles
    Median: 322 cycles
    Std Dev: 4.13 cycles
    95% CI: [321.90, 323.52] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 296.48 cycles
    Median: 296 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.62 cycles
    95% CI: [296.15, 296.81] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  CryptOpt is significantly faster than GAS (95% CI non-overlapping)
  CryptOpt is significantly faster than NASM (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
