=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     419 cycles
  NASM Format:    404 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 430 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -2.56% (430 vs 419 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -6.05% (430 vs 404 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.272% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 0.407% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 1.411% (Good (CV < 5%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 419.11 cycles
    Median: 419 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.14 cycles
    95% CI: [418.89, 419.33] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 403.96 cycles
    Median: 404 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.64 cycles
    95% CI: [403.58, 404.34] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 430.34 cycles
    Median: 430 cycles
    Std Dev: 6.07 cycles
    95% CI: [429.15, 431.53] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
