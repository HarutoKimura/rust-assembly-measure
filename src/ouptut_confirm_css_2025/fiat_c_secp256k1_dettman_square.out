=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     182 cycles
  NASM Format:    182 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 220 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -17.27% (220 vs 182 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -17.27% (220 vs 182 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 1.257% (Good (CV < 5%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.833% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 182.00 cycles
    Median: 182 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [182.00, 182.00] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 180.55 cycles
    Median: 182 cycles
    Std Dev: 2.27 cycles
    95% CI: [180.11, 180.99] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 220.49 cycles
    Median: 220 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.84 cycles
    95% CI: [220.13, 220.85] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
