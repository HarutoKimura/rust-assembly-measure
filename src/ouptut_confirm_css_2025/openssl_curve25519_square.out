Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
