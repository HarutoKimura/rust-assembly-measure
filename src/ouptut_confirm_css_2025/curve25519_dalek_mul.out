=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     148 cycles
  NASM Format:    139 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 159 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -6.92% (159 vs 148 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -12.58% (159 vs 139 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 0.346% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.327% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 148.00 cycles
    Median: 148 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [148.00, 148.00] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 138.64 cycles
    Median: 139 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.48 cycles
    95% CI: [138.54, 138.75] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 158.57 cycles
    Median: 159 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.52 cycles
    95% CI: [158.46, 158.69] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
