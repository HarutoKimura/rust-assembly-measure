=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     198 cycles
  NASM Format:    202 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 242 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -18.18% (242 vs 198 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -16.53% (242 vs 202 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 1.460% (Good (CV < 5%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 1.460% (Good (CV < 5%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.786% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 199.53 cycles
    Median: 198 cycles
    Std Dev: 2.91 cycles
    95% CI: [198.96, 200.10] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 200.03 cycles
    Median: 202 cycles
    Std Dev: 2.92 cycles
    95% CI: [199.46, 200.60] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 242.78 cycles
    Median: 242 cycles
    Std Dev: 1.91 cycles
    95% CI: [242.38, 243.17] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
