=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     81 cycles
  NASM Format:    82 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 99 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: -18.18% (99 vs 81 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: -17.17% (99 vs 82 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 81.00 cycles
    Median: 81 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [81.00, 81.00] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 82.00 cycles
    Median: 82 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [82.00, 82.00] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 99.00 cycles
    Median: 99 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [99.00, 99.00] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GAS is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  NASM is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
