=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (100 runs):
  GAS Format:     330 cycles
  NASM Format:    334 cycles
  CryptOpt Format: 273 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GAS: +20.88% (273 vs 330 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs NASM: +22.34% (273 vs 334 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GAS Format:     CV = 1.390% (Good (CV < 5%))
  NASM Format:    CV = 2.480% (Good (CV < 5%))
  CryptOpt Format: CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))

Detailed Statistics (across 100 runs):
  GAS Format:
    Mean: 328.61 cycles
    Median: 330 cycles
    Std Dev: 4.57 cycles
    95% CI: [327.71, 329.51] cycles
  NASM Format:
    Mean: 327.39 cycles
    Median: 334 cycles
    Std Dev: 8.12 cycles
    95% CI: [325.80, 328.98] cycles
  CryptOpt Format:
    Mean: 273.00 cycles
    Median: 273 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [273.00, 273.00] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  CryptOpt is significantly faster than GAS (95% CI non-overlapping)
  CryptOpt is significantly faster than NASM (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
