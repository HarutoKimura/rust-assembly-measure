=== FINAL ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT ===
Methodology: CryptOpt-style with memory barriers, randomized batching, and statistical analysis
Measurement quality validation: Coefficient of variation tracking

Median-of-Medians Results (31 runs):
  GCC Baseline: 158 cycles
  Clang Baseline: 154 cycles
  CryptOpt Ratio12750: 165 cycles

Relative Performance (median-of-medians):
  CryptOpt vs GCC: -4.24% (165 vs 158 cycles)
  CryptOpt vs Clang: -6.67% (165 vs 154 cycles)

Measurement Stability Analysis:
  GCC Baseline: CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  Clang Baseline: CV = 0.000% (Excellent (CV < 1%))
  CryptOpt Ratio12750: CV = 2.571% (Good (CV < 5%))

Detailed Statistics (across 31 runs):
  GCC Baseline:
    Mean: 158.00 cycles
    Median: 158 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [158.00, 158.00] cycles
  Clang Baseline:
    Mean: 154.00 cycles
    Median: 154 cycles
    Std Dev: 0.00 cycles
    95% CI: [154.00, 154.00] cycles
  CryptOpt Ratio12750:
    Mean: 167.94 cycles
    Median: 165 cycles
    Std Dev: 4.32 cycles
    95% CI: [166.35, 169.52] cycles

Statistical Significance Assessment:
  GCC is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)
  Clang is significantly faster than CryptOpt (95% CI non-overlapping)

Note: This enhanced methodology addresses reviewer concerns about:
  ✓ Memory barriers (mfence before rdtsc)
  ✓ Randomized batch execution order (Fisher-Yates)
  ✓ Proper warm-up procedures
  ✓ Statistical analysis with coefficient of variation
  ✓ Dynamic batch sizing based on cycle goals
  • CPU pinning and frequency control: Use setup_benchmark_environment.sh
