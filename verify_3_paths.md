# How to Verify the Exact 3 Paths

## Method 1: Run BINSEC with Debug Logging

Modify the BINSEC command to include debug output that shows which addresses trigger the "non executable" warning:

```bash
eval $(opam env 2>/dev/null) && \
binsec/_build/install/default/bin/binsec \
  -sse \
  -sse-script <config> \
  -sse-debug-level 4 \
  -loglevel debug \
  <binary> 2>&1 | grep -E "(non executable|Cut path)"
```

This should show lines like:
```
Cut path X (non executable) @ 0xADDRESS
```

## Method 2: Create Minimal Test Cases

1. **Test with just return from main**:
```c
int main() { return 0; }
```

2. **Test with explicit exit**:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() { exit(0); }
```

3. **Test with infinite loop** (should have 0 non-executable paths):
```c
int main() { while(1); }
```

## Method 3: Analyze the Binary's Exit Sequences

The 3 paths likely correspond to these addresses:
1. The address after `__libc_start_main` returns
2. The `hlt` instruction at 0x401585
3. Some error handler or PLT stub that jumps to unmapped memory

## Method 4: Modify BINSEC to Print More Information

You could modify `binsec/src/sse/exec.ml` line 763 to print more details:

```ocaml
Logger.warning "@[<hov>Cut path %d (non executable) %@ %a (trying to execute from here)@]"
  (Path.id path) Virtual_address.pp addr;
```

Then recompile BINSEC to see exactly which addresses cause the issue.
